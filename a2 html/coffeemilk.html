<p>Storing milk/dairy alternatives properly ensures the drinks are safe and of a good quality. If milk/dairy alternatives are not stored correctly, they will rapidly develop signs of spoilage and potentially grow bacteria to an unsafe level. For all milk/dairy alternatives you should ensure that:
	The fridge temperature never exceeds 8°C.
	Stacks of milk pouches never exceed 6 high to maintain stability.
	All milk/dairy alternatives must be removed from the fridge in the correct date rotation.
	Milk/dairy alternatives should always be stored in the fridge between coffee orders.
	Cartons of dairy alternatives such as soya,must be day dotted with a shelf life of 5 days (4 days for ~Lacto Free milk) and stored in the fridge once opened.
	It's recommended that you have dairy alternatives stored in the fridge prior to opening the carton to enhance the quality of drinks you will serve.
	Dairy alternatives should also be stored in a separate fridge (or shelf) to avoid cross contamination

  Whatever preparation method you are using, there are some key standards to follow:
Always fill the jug to the correct level.
Ensure that the temperature is between 140°F to 160°F - if they are heated below 140°F, drinks will be too cold; if they are heated over 160°F, it will be burnt and therefore negatively impact the flavour of the drink.
If you are using the 600 ml jug, you will need to turn the steam off sooner, 120°F for milk/dairy alternatives and 130ºF chocolate preparation to ensure it does not exceed 160°F. 
Be aware that once heated, they can continue to be used until it drops below 140°F.
If milk is requested extra hot by the customer switch off at 160°F.
Using the correct sized jug prevents re-heating and saves unnecessary waste. It also always ensure customers have the best tasting/looking drink at all times</p>
