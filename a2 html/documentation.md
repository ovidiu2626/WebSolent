##Colour Choice

I used a mix colour of black coffee beans and white milk colour. Grey colour is the most used as based for the website as this it is about a coffee and milk drinks.
The text is black to create a very good contrast and to keep the information simple.
For GDPR i used a blue colour logo, as it is a base on Europe Union flag and to be in contrast with the entire website.

##Accessibility

I used the ALT feature in case some person who do not understand English, can have look at the picture and understand that that topic it is about a coffee with milk for example.
Or in case there is a slow connection with the website, it will show the text quickly instead loading the full page with image.

##GDPR

I upload the General Data Protection Regulation law definition and on which area on the glob does it apply.
As well how the personal data controllers and processors must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles.
I have written down The 8 individual rights.

##Distance Selling

My website does not require any distance selling because i am not selling any product or service.


##Evaluation
I got inspiration from first assignment.
I did not encounter any big problem as the teacher was 5 star and i understood from beginner.
I used Chrome tool names device toolbar to help me test on different screen sizes.
When i reduce screen i set the break point at 300px the navigation link stuck in top each other.
