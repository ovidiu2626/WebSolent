<p>Espresso is a coffee-making method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast levels. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique. The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets. The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam. The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy. This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage. These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms. This preserves the strong coffee flavor present in the espresso. Espresso is also the base for various coffee drinks—including caffè latte, cappuccino, caffè macchiato, caffè mocha, flat white, and caffè Americano.

  Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but because the usual serving size is much smaller, the total caffeine content is less than a mug of standard brewed coffee. The actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, but a typical serving of espresso usually contains 120 to 170 milligrams of caffeine, whereas a typical serving of drip coffee usually contains 150 to 200 mg.</p>

<p>Aromatic, fresh beans produce the best quality coffee. Correct storage is essential to maintain the coffee's freshness and flavour.
	The Coffee is packaged in foil bags with a special valve that allows no air to get in but for the natural CO2 gases to escape. Air makes our coffee go stale very quickly, leaving it with a dull flavour.
	There are a number of shelf life standards to follow to ensure the quality of the coffee is always at its best.
  <br><br>
Coffee beans should be kept away from direct heat or sunlight.
Ideally coffee beans should be kept at an ambient temperature of between 19°C - 23°C. Higher temperatures cause beans to sweat, lose oils and oxidise.
The shelf life for opened bags of coffee is 48 hours. Always keep your opened coffee bags in a cool, dry place. Freezing is not recommended.
As soon as bags of beans are opened they start to oxidise and lose their oils. Therefore, the open bags must be rolled down and sealed to prevent air from entering.</p>
<p>ESPRESSO EXTRACTION STANDARDS:
Every espresso should have a crema which seals the coffee and maintains the aroma and flavour for as long as possible. When extracted correctly the perfect espresso should be balanced and deliver the correct flavours (tastes) and aromas (smells).
The espresso has a balance of acidity, bitterness and sweetness.</p>

<p>The formula for the perfect solo espresso is:
14 grams of ground coffee x 20 seconds of extraction = 2x30ml (+/- 2mls variance) of coffee (minimum 3mms of Crema)</p>
